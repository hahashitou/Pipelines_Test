<p><strong>Iterate through distributors and send them emails with the
details of the new ice cream line</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deploy the Json in your logic app resource in
Portal</strong>. <strong><a

The logic has few important steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>initially the http trigger, that trigger the flow of the logic
app.</p></li>
<li><p>The Html construct. We can do this by getting the html from the
challenge and putting this into the table.</p></li>
<li><p>The construct of the html would be mixed with the get product api
call.</p></li>
<li><p>Connecting to Dynamics and getting the customer information with
new Dataverse connector.</p></li>
<li><p>Running the “Send an email” connector in For loop by the number
of customers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="additional-notes"><u>Additional Notes:</u></h2>
<p>You can retrieve the main contacts of the distributors from the
distributor’s Dynamics 365 CRM systems with the following detail:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>User: duser@microsoftopenhack.onmicrosoft.com

Password: pass@word1

Environment: Microsoft OpenHack (msftopenhack)

Entity: Contacts</code></pre>
<p>Viewing records to select the entity from the distributor’s Dynamics
365 CRM system can take several seconds. Please be patient.</p>
<p>The Email field from each contact contains the email address to be
used for each distributor contact.</p>
<p>The email should also contain your team number in the subject. Feel
free to also add the email address of someone in your team in CC so you
can see what the emails look like.</p>
<p><strong>HINT</strong>: The same credentials for user and password as
listed above can also be used to send emails from Office 365 Outlook Add
your own email address to the list and/or review the workflow executions
to see the emails sent to validate the emails are sent as expected to
multiple distributors.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-5-responses">Challenge 5 Responses</h2>
<p>Read the challenge responses (list them from the coach’s deck)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The email looks correct in an HTML format and with the list of
products<br />
<em>As per the logic app the document is created in the variable before
then push it in the email connector body. Which is housed inside the
loop.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Your coach will be able to validate that the distributors have
received the email with your HTML content</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your team number is in the email subject</p></li>
<li><p>Once the coach has validated the email, show the implementation
to them</p></li>
</ul>
