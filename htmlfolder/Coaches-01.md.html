<h1 id="serverless-openhack">Serverless OpenHack</h1>
<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<p>The challenges in this Serverless OpenHack are based on real world
and validated scenarios from customers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Application Backend / API Hosting</strong> - A very
common scenario, utilizing Azure Functions and Logic Apps to implement a
full API for a solution. Sometimes the API itself is the main solution
that the customer sells; it can be combined with Azure API
Management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business and Systems Integration with Workflow</strong> -
A recurring scenario with customers is to create a workflow between
multiple systems (systems integration); some are business workflow often
with human interaction (business workflow).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User or Telemetry data processing</strong> - Using Azure
Functions to process, split, or forward external user and telemetry data
coming in via Event Hubs, IoT Hub, or other; and running a workflow
using Logic Apps for specific alerts. Good fit for solutions with under
100,000 messages per second with no actor model requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other scenarios for serverless of course; we are only
covering these that have been validated by CSE with multiple customers.
This should give the audience a good understanding of serverless on
Azure and how it works with the rest of the Azure services.</p>
<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<p>The event targets all developers but has an emphasis on developers
building business and enterprise solutions. These challenges are very
compelling to ISVs as well as they go well with the microservices
architecture with a consumption-based plan.</p>
<p>Attendees do not need previous knowledge of Azure or Azure Serverless
offerings. Its preferred to have basic knowledge of C# or Node.js but is
not a requirement.</p>
<p>There may be attendees that do not have experience with application
development, instead wanting to focus on the infrastructure and
connectivity of the Azure offerings. Direct those participants to the
“bonus” supporting tasks throughout the challenges, which focus on
developing the infrastructure as code needed to deploy and configure the
Serverless offerings. They can also be encouraged to drive discussions
about how best to secure each of the components.</p>
<p>As challenges progress, depending on the speed of the developers
working with the Serverless components, it may be difficult for all the
infrastructure to be coded and deployed in lock step with the
developers. Encourage the “infrastructure coders” to at least
demonstrate the path they might take to incorporate each new service as
it comes into play for the challenge. This might be as easy as locating
documenation or sample code references.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>On top of general OpenHack goals to improve Azure services, improve
documentation, and evangelize these technologies, there are other goals
we are focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Emphasize the time to market and ease of getting applications
built using serverless</p></li>
<li><p>How serverless can bring a varied of PaaS services together with
ease of integration</p></li>
<li><p>Expand integration for enterprise scenarios to bring business
applications together</p></li>
<li><p>Help upskill attendees on how serverless can solve real world
problems when communicating with various modules</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Facilitate Collaboration​</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="end-of-day-sync">End of day sync</h2>
<p>For the internal coaches sync at the end of each day, there are three
questions you should ask each of your teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you accomplish today?</li>
<li>What was the biggest challenge today?</li>
<li>Is there anything we can do better tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-things-to-keep-in-mind">Some things to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>No step-by-step instructions or “right” answer​</li>
<li>Not all pain points are removed​</li>
<li>Everyone should be learning and having fun. That includes YOU!​</li>
<li>Keep Challenge Content and reference solutions private​</li>
<li>Teams probably won’t complete all challenges. Even though we have a
leaderboard, it’s important that they learn and not cut corners, it’s ok
for them to stay in the early challenges, and the objective is NOT to
finish all challenges</li>
</ul>
