Management</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Now that the Best For You Organics (BFYOC) API is complete, they want
to start tracking telemetry from their API calls to be able to monitor
the solution. After all, if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve
it!</p>
<p>BFYOC would also like to begin exposing their APIs. They want to
ensure the the APIs use consistent URL. They also want them exposed as
different suites of APIs. They would like to have a different suite of
APIs exposed to the mobile application, internal business users running
reports and external partners. They also want to ensure that their
mobile users receive priority access to those APIs by throttling
requests from both internal business users and external partners.</p>
<h2 id="telemetry">Telemetry</h2>
<p>The first part of this challenge is to work as a team to enable
telemetry for the production Ratings API functions. BFYOC has requested
a table derived from telemetry that displays the following information
about your Ratings functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of times each function was run in the past
hour</p></li>
<li><p>The average duration of each function in that hour</p></li>
<li><p>There should be one row for each of the three Ratings functions
your team created earlier</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Application Insights may take a few minutes
before showing telemetry from your functions</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="api-exposure">API Exposure</h2>
<h3 id="uniform-url">Uniform URL</h3>
<p>Next your team is to create a uniformly addressed version of the
entire API. This includes the <code>GetUser</code>,
<code>GetProduct</code> and <code>GetProducts</code> APIs that already
existed, and all the production functions your team created:
<code>CreateRating</code>, <code>GetRating</code>, and
<code>GetRatings</code>. Your team should expose all of these operations
under the same base URL, as they currently are under different base
URLs.</p>
<h3 id="product-suites">Product suites</h3>
<p>Your team will now need to create 3 suites of APIs. One for each of
the use cases: Mobile Application, Internal business users and External
Partners. The team will need to configure the products so that only the
required operations are exposed to the different product suites. Those
requirements are as follows:</p>
<h4 id="mobile-applications">Mobile Applications</h4>
<p>The Mobile Application requires access to all of the APIs. Each of
them is required for different areas of the application’s UX. So the
operations that need to be configured for this product suite are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetUser</li>
<li>GetProduct</li>
<li>GetProducts</li>
<li>CreateRating</li>
<li>GetRating</li>
<li>GetRatings</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="internal-business-users">Internal business users</h4>
<p>The Internal business users use the APIs for reporting purposes. They
need access to the product and rating information but shouldn’t be using
the user operation or be able to create ratings. So the operations that
should be exposed to this product suite are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetProduct</li>
<li>GetProducts</li>
<li>GetRating</li>
<li>GetRatings</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-partners">External Partners</h4>
<p>The External Partners use case is to be able to see products that
BYFOC has to offer, so should only have the product operations exposed
to them. So this product suite should only have the following operations
exposed to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetProduct</li>
<li>GetProducts</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="throttling">Throttling</h3>
<p>Finally, we need to ensure that our Mobile Application users are
given priority over use of these APIs. We need to create some throttling
on the operations exposed to the Internal business users and the
External Partners.</p>
<p>Your team will need to create policies that ensure that the Internal
business users do not make more than 30 calls within a 10 second time
period on the operations that are exposed through this product
suite.</p>
<p>The External Partners should also be throttled, but shouldn’t be
throttled as greatly. The operations exposed to our partners should be
limited to 60 calls per 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The mobile applications users shouldn’t have any throttling
configured on the operations exposed to them.</p>
<h2 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Demonstrate to your coach the implementation of how to check the
total number of times and the average duration of each function for the
past hour based on telemetry. The results should be displayed as a
table, in the same result set, and have one row for each of the three
production Ratings API functions you created in the previous
challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No need to store the results in a data store, on screen display of
the results is sufficient</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate to your coach the implementation of exposing a
uniform API under the same base URL for all functions</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate to your coach the configuration of the 3 different
product suites and the operations exposed to each of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate to your coach the implementation of the rate limiting
requirements. The results should have different policies configured on
the Internal business users product suite then on the External Partners
product suite. There should be no throttling configured on the Mobile
Applications product suite.</p></li>
