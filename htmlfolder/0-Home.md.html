<h1 id="serverless-openhack">Serverless OpenHack</h1>
<p>Test 2022/07/28 Test now Serverless computing allows for scalable and
reliable event based processing for code and workflows. It accelerates
the development of applications while hiding the infrastructure and
providing auto-scale and micro-billing. Serverless technologies like
Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Event Grid are some of the services
being adopted by development teams in startups, ISVs, and enterprises to
implement new or extend existing solutions. Companies that adopt
serverless benefit from a fast time to market and only pay for what they
use.</p>
<p>These services work in combination with other Azure services and form
the core of this OpenHack and underpin everything youâ€™ll be exploring as
you progress through the challenges.</p>

<p><img style="float: right;" height="160" src="https://serverlessoh.azureedge.net/public/ice-cream-2202561_320-circle.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Best For You Organics Company (BFYOC)</strong> is an ice
cream company with over 200 stores worldwide. BFYOC has focused on fresh
ingredients, locally sourced, and seasonal. Their 26 flavors range from
the ordinary vanilla, to the ever popular avocado toast (which is a much
better flavor than it sounds). They are now creating a new line of fruit
flavored ice creams and are preparing to launch onto the market.</p>
<p>Because premium ingredients is key to their success, their profit
margins are relatively low, as they try to keep prices affordable for
consumers. As such, every sale needs to be optimized, and every customer
needs to leave happy. They also need to cut costs whenever possible,
which of course impacts their budget for new technology.</p>
<p>BFYOC would like to launch a new customer feedback tool to analyze
their sales and customer satisfaction levels. Because feedback posts
from customers will be sporadic, they are looking for options that can
automatically scale, and minimize investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>In addition, they would like to streamline their inventory and
ordering process to reduce costs and product waste. They want to be able
to notify distributors of new ice creams, and automate the processing of
new orders based on inventory.</p>
