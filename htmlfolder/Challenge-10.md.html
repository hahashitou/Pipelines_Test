<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As Best For You Organics Company (BFYOC) now has data from customer
reviews, distributor orders, and POS sales for the new fruit flavored
ice cream line, the product managers would like to know how the new line
of ice creams are doing.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>Your challenge is to work on a solution that monitors and forwards
the reviews, distributor orders, and POS sales data to an
event-processing engine that will then, every 5 minutes, summarize the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of ice creams based on total distributor orders total sales,
from highest to lowest</li>
<li>A list of ice creams based on total POS sales, from highest to
lowest</li>
<li>The average sentiment analysis value for each ice cream</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregate the data for each 5 minute tumbling window and then use
that data to generate a report for your manager (your coach) with these
insights.</p>
<h2 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Demonstrate to your coach how you implemented the
solution</p></li>
<li><p>The coach should have access to a report that includes all the
required info as per the Challenge section.</p></li>
